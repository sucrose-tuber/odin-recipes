        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        My uncultured friends always describe my breakfast as "weird" when I serve this to them. In reality, it's a very common dish in Latin America. I will assume in Africa as well because the only photo I could find available for public use was written in Igbo.

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Banana or plaintain</li>
            <li>1 or 2 eggs, depending how hungry you are</li>
            <li>Half a can of beans because I never remember to soak uncooked beans overnight</li>
            <li>Oil, preferably vegetable (lighter flavor compared to others)</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Tabasco sauce (red if you like spicy, green if you like flavor, or both)</li>
        </ul>
