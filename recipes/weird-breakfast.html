        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        My uncultured friends always describe my breakfast as "weird" when I serve this to them. In reality, it's a very common dish in Latin America. I will assume in Africa as well because the only photo I could find available for public use was written in Igbo.

        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Banana or plaintain</li>
            <li>1 or 2 eggs, depending how hungry you are</li>
            <li>Half a can of beans because I never remember to soak uncooked beans overnight</li>
            <li>Oil, preferably vegetable (lighter flavor compared to others)</li>
            <li>Shredded cheese</li>
            <li>Tabasco sauce (red if you like spicy, green if you like flavor, or both)</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Boil the canned beans if you like them extra soft, otherwise heating them in a microwaveable bowl works if you don't have time</li>
            <li>Cut banana/plaintains into slices</li>
            <li>Fry the slices with vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Set them aside on your plate</li>
            <li>Fry your egg the way you like (I personally like scrambled for this specific recipe)</li>
            <li>In your bowl, layer the cooked ingredients in this order: beans, Tabasco sauce, shredded cheese, egg, plaintain</li>
            <li>I try to eat it like a cake so I can get all the flavors but you can also mix the ingredients</li>
        </ol>
